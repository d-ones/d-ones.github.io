Iâ€™m a US-based programmer by trade & by hobby with significant professional experience in designing ETL processes. I have specific expertise in processes written in Python and SQL and orchestrated using containerized applications such as Docker and Kubernetes and using platforms such as Airflow.<br>\---\
My current personal interests include geospatial technologies and web mapping, minimalist/Web1.0 web design and hosting, Scala, Go, vim, and learning more about the works/thoughts of peers.<br>\---\
I'm always open to contributing on projects. Please reach out in my resource links.
